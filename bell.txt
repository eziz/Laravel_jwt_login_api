This is all computed based on the activated_date, so you can use accessors like this:

// User Model
protected $casts = [
    'activated_date' => 'date',
];
public function endDate(): Attribute
{
return new Attribute(
fn () => $this->activated_date ? $this->activated_date->addDays(90) :  null
);
}


public function activated(): Attribute
{
return new Attribute(fn () => (bool) $this->activated_date);
}


public function deactivated(): Attribute
{
return new Attribute(fn () => $this->activated_date->eq($this->end_date));
}

I don't know if the deactivated property makes a lot of sense, you are only deactive when the two dates are equal???
